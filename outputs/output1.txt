Location #0 is set to 10
Executing Instruction #0
Done excuting instruction1
Got value: 10from location #0
Got value: 10from location #0
Location #1 is set to 100
Executing Instruction #1 ==> multiplying memory location 0 with value 10 and memory location 0 with value 10 and storing the result in memory location 1 with value 100
Done excuting instruction2
Executing Instruction #2
Done excuting instruction4
Got value: 100from location #1
Location #2 is set to -100
Executing Instruction #4 ==> negating memory location 1 with value 100 and storing the result in memory location 2 with value -100
Done excuting instruction5
SIM stopped at instuction #5
Done excuting instruction6
